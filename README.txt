This is Iterative QuickSort algorithm with O(1) space complexity


Description:

Let's say we have " A' " array obtained at some iteration of sorting array "A".
After partitioning array into two subarrays it searches for the greatest element in
right subarray and puts it right after pivot. After we finish left subarray sorting 
we use this element to indicate the end of right subarray (the first element greater
than ours is the beginnig of the other part of "A" array)
